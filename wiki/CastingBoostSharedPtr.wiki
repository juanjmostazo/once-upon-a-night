#summary Casting a shared_ptr to a shared_ptr to a subclass.

= Code example =
The method GUISubsystem::createGUI() returns a shared pointer to a GUIWindow base class.

If we want to downcast that pointer to a smart pointer to an instance of a subclass, we need to use boost::dynamic_pointer_cast. The way to achieve this would be:

{{{
mGUI = boost::dynamic_pointer_cast<GUIConsole>(mApp->getGUISubsystem()->createGUI(GUI_LAYOUT_CONSOLE));
}}}
