h1. Do not link to this directory

On a successful compile, the build solution will copy all related headers and libraries to the "sdk" directory.

These are the following parameters you should append to your project linker settings.

* Additional Include Directories (.h) -> @c:/dev/NxOgre/sdk/@
* Additional Library Directories (.lib) -> @c:/dev/NxOgre/sdk/@
* Additional Dependencies -> @NxOgre.lib@ for Release or @NxOgre_Debug.lib@ for Debug.

Copy the file @c:/dev/NxOgre/sdk/NxOgre.dll@ or @NxOgre_Debug.dll@ to your application directory.

For a first time user, you should follow one of the many tutorials by Spacegaier or have a look at Cake to set up your application.
