Q: Do I have to use the NxOgre Rendersystems with my application/game/library/pony?
A: No, at all. You can write your own. Treat the RenderSystem nearest to what as a guideline
   when you implement you own. 

Q: I noticed they are open sourced static libraries, Do I have to open source my code to?
A: No. Feel free to keep it closed-source. You can also use them in commerical projects to.

Q: Do I have to use the term body in my code, can I use my own?
A: No you can call it Francis and of course you can use your own.

Q: Can I inherit from the RigidBody instead of the Actor?
A: Yes, you would implement it in the same way Actor is. Reading the Actor source code will
   tell you exactly which RigidBody functions to use.

Q: Can I implement my own version of a StaticGeometry, if I use the RigidBody and RigidBodyFunctions?
A: Yes and volumes too.
